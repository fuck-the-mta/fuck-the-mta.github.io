    <h1>Fuck the MTA</h1>
    <p>
      <i>Fuck the MTA</i> is a political action committee primarily dedicated to the goal of
      making New York City's official motto &#8220;Fuck the MTA.&#8221; The secondary goal of
      <i>Fuck the MTA</i> is to promote policies to improve the public transportation for all
      residents of New York City (even those in Staten Island) to the point at which "Fuck the
      MTA" is not the most common phrase uttered in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are currently awaiting approval from the FEC, after which we will open up donations, with
      which we will use for purchasing advertising space across the city to promote our stated goals.
